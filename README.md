# URLToGif
A server that turns everything after the server address to a gif

You need a (preferably monospace) font in the same directory as "main.go" file, you can just get a random font and call it ubuntumono.ttf and be done with it. :p

You can get dependencies with this command
```
$ go get -u github.com/fogleman/gg
```

You can run it with this command:
```
go run main.go
```
Port 3005 is the default port
This is the output of ``localhost:3005/URLToGif``
